                system in a Svelte application. Published by Educative.

            <p>
                In this project, we will start working on a skeleton Svelte
                application and incorporate a store to effectively manage
                notification information. After this, we will create Svelte
                components designed to subscribe to the store and facilitate the
                display of these notifications.
